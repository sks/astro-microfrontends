# astro-microfrontends

This demo takes advantage of EcmaScript Modules (ESM) and url-imports to do client-side composition of microfrontends. Express is used for serving assets, but ideally one would have a dedicated CDN hosting them.

## Features

- âœ¨ Client-side composition of microfrontends
- ðŸ“¦ Multiframeworks with Astro Islands
- ðŸš€ SSG/SSR supported by Astro

## Usage

- Build each microfrontend with `npm run build`
- Start each microfrontend with `cd dist && http-server -p <PORT> --cors`
- Start the shell with `npm run dev`

## Shared dependencies

Dependencies such as react and react-dom are shared across micro-frontends. Due to a constraint in Astro, react and react dom cannot be shared with the shell app.

Each app can share other dependencies through url imports that gets cached in the browser, thus reducing the bundle size (see [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/)).

I recomend using either importmaps in the client or ahead of time importmaps at build time to share those dependencies, this demo uses the latter.
